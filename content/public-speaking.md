I am lucky to be able to travel all over the world to speak on topics that I feel passionate about.

Feel free to [contact me](contact) me if you'd like me to speak at your event or conference. I like to have fun and engage with the audience; if you're looking for an accomplished orator, you'll have to continue looking somewhere else. 

However, if you want someone to speak passionately about a topic, count me in!

I will always give priority to diverse and inclusive events -- for attendees as well as speakers.
